Hereâ€™s a detailed to-do list for building a geolocation-based attendance tracker using Node.js:

### 1. **Setup and Initialization**
   - [ ] Create a new Node.js project and initialize it with `package.json`.
   - [ ] Install necessary packages:
     - Express (for backend API)
     - Mongoose (for MongoDB, if using a database)
     - Node-Geocoder (to convert coordinates to locations, if required)
     - JWT (for user authentication)
     - Geolib (to handle geolocation and distance calculations)
     - Other utilities like dotenv, cors, nodemon, etc.

### 2. **Database Setup**
   - [ ] Choose a database (e.g., MongoDB) and set up a connection.
   - [ ] Create models for:
     - **User:** Store user details (name, email, role).
     - **Attendance:** Store attendance records, with fields like userId, date, time, and geolocation data (latitude, longitude).
     - **Location/Geofence (Optional):** Define allowed geofence or location for tracking attendance.

### 3. **Authentication**
   - [ ] Implement user authentication using JWT (Login and Sign up).
   - [ ] Protect the attendance tracking API to ensure only authenticated users can access it.

### 4. **Geolocation and Distance Calculation**
   - [ ] Implement a route to capture geolocation (latitude, longitude) of the user from the client-side device.
   - [ ] Use **Geolib** to calculate if the user's geolocation falls within the specified range (geofence) for valid attendance.

### 5. **Attendance Logic**
   - [ ] Define the attendance rules (e.g., must be within 100 meters of the office/school location).
   - [ ] On successful geolocation capture within the allowed range, mark attendance by creating an entry in the Attendance model with timestamp and location.

### 6. **Frontend Integration**
   - [ ] Develop the frontend (React/React Native) or integrate the backend API with an existing frontend.
   - [ ] Use **Navigator.geolocation** API on the frontend to capture user's current location and send it to the backend.

### 7. **Tracking and Reports**
   - [ ] Implement APIs to retrieve attendance history by user or by date.
   - [ ] Create a dashboard to visualize or generate reports based on attendance data.

### 8. **Testing**
   - [ ] Test geolocation accuracy and distance calculation.
   - [ ] Ensure correct behavior for valid and invalid attendance locations.
   - [ ] Verify user authentication and attendance flow.

### 9. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Set up environment variables for the geolocation service and database.
   - [ ] Deploy the application to a server (e.g., Heroku, AWS) and configure the database.

### 10. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Write clear documentation for APIs, authentication, and attendance logic.
